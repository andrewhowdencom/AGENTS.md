# Project Template

This repository serves as a template for new software projects. It includes a set of guidelines and
configurations to ensure consistency and quality in the development process, especially when working with AI
software engineers.

## AGENTS.md

The `AGENTS.md` file is a crucial part of this template. It provides a detailed set of instructions and best
practices for AI software engineers (agents) who will be working on the project. The purpose of this file is to
guide the agent in a way that aligns with the project's architectural principles, coding standards, and
development workflow.

By following the instructions in `AGENTS.md`, the AI agent can understand the project's architecture and
dependency management, follow the prescribed code layout and organization, and implement CI/CD pipelines using
GitHub Actions. The agent will also be able to create well-documented and user-friendly command-line interfaces
(CLIs), manage application configuration effectively, and adhere to Git best practices for version control.
Furthermore, the instructions guide the agent in using the designated task runner for common development tasks,
writing high-quality code in specified programming languages like Go, implementing thorough testing using a
test-driven development (TDD) approach, and utilizing dependency injection for better code organization.

In essence, `AGENTS.md` is the blueprint that enables the AI agent to contribute to the project in a
consistent, efficient, and high-quality manner.
